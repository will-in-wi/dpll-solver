# DPLL Solver

This is an example for a project in Thomas Edison State University's Artificial Intelligence couse.

You can modify the sentence in `solver.rb`. Run with `ruby -Ilib solver.rb`.

You can run the test suite with `bin/rspec`. You will need Ruby and Bundler installed.

*Note to any future students of this same course: I highly recommend that you figure this out and then try my solver, not the other way around. You are responsible for the ethical questions of cheating.*
